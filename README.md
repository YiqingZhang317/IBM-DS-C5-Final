# IBM-DS-C5-Final
This is my final project for the 5th course ("Python Project for Data Science") of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The purpose of this project is to analyze historical stock/revenue data and build a dashboard. The two companies I investigated are Tesla and GameStop.
